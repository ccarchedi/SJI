""" Extract partial derivatives matrix for an inversion.

These codes are used to convert from the Frechet kernels calculated by MINEOS
into kernels that are useful for our inversion model.


************  MINEOS G MATRIX *************
We start by assembling the MINEOS Frechet kernels into a more useful G matrix,
    n_Love_periods+n_Rayleigh_periods x n_depth_points*5 (SV, SH, PV, PH, ETA)
This is filled in by the frechet kernels for each period - first the vsv and
vsh T frechet kernels (sensitivities from Love) rows, then the vsv, (vsh set
to 0), vpv, vph, eta S frechet kernels (sensitivities from Rayleigh) rows:


********** INVERSION G MATRIX ************
The Frechet kernels from MINEOS are given at the same depths as those in
the MINEOS model card, as a function of the model card v(z).  However, we
want to invert for a model in a different format, p, so we need to adjust
the kernels accordingly.
420
Let   m:    old model, as a function of depth, from MINEOS card
            multiple parameters - [vsv, vsh, vpv, vph, eta]
      p:    new model
            multiple parameters - [s, t]
      c:    observed phase velocities, Love stacked on top of Rayleigh

The MINEOS kernels are a matrix of dc/dm
    i.e.   dc_0/dvsv_0, ..., dc_0/dvsv_M, dc_0/dvsh_0, ..., dc_0/deta_M
        [       :     ,  : ,      :     ,      :     ,  : ,      :      ]
            dc_N/dvsv_0, ..., dc_N/dvsv_M, dc_N/dvsh_0, ..., dcN_deta_M

We want a matrix of dc/dp
    i.e.   dc_0/ds_0, ..., dc_0/ds_P, dc_0/dt_0, ..., dc_0/dt_D
        [       :   ,  : ,    :     ,    :     ,  : ,    :      ]
           dc_N/ds_0, ..., dc_N/ds_P, dc_N/dt_0, ..., dc_N/dt_D


As dx/dy = dx/da * da/dy, we need to find the matrix dm/dp
    i.e.   dvsv_0/ds_0, ..., dvsv_0/ds_P, dvsv_0/dt_0, ..., dvsv_0/dt_D
                :     ,  : ,    :       ,    :       ,  : ,    :
        [  dvsv_M/ds_0, ..., dvsv_M/ds_P, dvsv_M/dt_0, ..., dvsv_M/dt_D  ]
           dvsh_0/ds_0, ..., dvsh_0/ds_P, dvsh_0/dt_0, ..., dvsh_0/dt_D
                :     ,  : ,    :       ,    :       ,  : ,    :
           deta_M/ds_0, ..., deta_M/ds_P, deta_M/dt_0, ..., deta_M/dt_D



***************** THE dm/dp MATRIX *******************
To convert the MINEOS kernels (dc/dm) to inversion model kernels (dc/dp),
we need to define the matrix dm/dp (dc/dp = dc/dm * dm/dp).  We divide
our inversion model, p, into two parts: the defined velocities at various
depths (s) and the depth and thickness of certain boundary layers of
interest (t).

It is simple to write an expression for m = v(z) in terms of the parameters
in p = [s; t].  To find dm/dp, all we need to do if take the partial derivative
of these expressions with respect to p.  The tricky parts of this...
    a. The dependence of m on p is different for s and for t
    b. The dependence of m on s is different for v(z) defined far from the
       varied point in p, p_i (i.e. separated from p_i by another node), and
       is different for those points immediately above and immediately below
       the node p_i (i.e. at depths between the depths of p_i-1 and p_i+1).
    c. The same is true for t, except it is even more complicated because we
       have set up t as varying the depth to a boundary layer with fixed width.
       As such, the points in z within the variable depth layer, the points in
       z within the boundary layer of fixed with but variable edge depths, and
       the points in z beneath the boundary layer with a fixed depth of base
       are all differently dependent on the variation in t.

       Note that for simplicity, we are not trying to account for the fact that
       sometimes a change in t will cause a point in z to switch from below to
       above a node (or vice versa).  This may cause issues down the line...
That said, the equations for m = f(p) are pretty simple in and of themselves,
so the actual partial derivatives are easy to work out - but how they are
assigned in the matrix dm/dp needs a bit more attention.

******************  THE dc/dp MATRIX ******************
Once we have G_MINEOS (i.e. dc/dm) and dm/dp, we can get our output Inversion
G matrix by a simple matrix multiplication.

    To convert from dc/dvsv to dc/dp, we can multiply dc/dvsv * dvsv/dp.
    However, given that we are only taking discrete samples, we need to
    integrate over the dc/dvsv kernels in depth.

    Assuming a linear interpolation between points, the integral between
    x = a and x = b
            ∫ f(x) dx =  1/2 Σ_i [(x_i+1 - x_i) (f(x_i) + f(x_i+1))]

    two points in x graphically.  Say f(x=a) < f(x=b).  The area beneath the
    line f(x=a) to f(x=b) is equal to the area of the rectangle up to the
    height of f(x=a) plus the area of the triangle with height f(x=b) - f(x=a).
    That is

    Then the sum comes from just adding off of these pointwise integrals).

    Note: this can be explicitly calculated in a (slow) loop.  Given that in the
    depth range of interest (i.e. everywhere that dm/dp is non-zero), the
    MINEOS card is sampled at a constant depth interval (if using the default
    values, this is 2 km:  step = model_params.min_layer_thickness / 3), this
    integral is really close to (fast!) matrix multiplication, where every

    """ Convert from Frechet kernels as function of v(z) to function of p.

    The Frechet kernels from MINEOS are given at the same depths as those in
    the MINEOS model card, as a function of the model card v(z).  However, we
    want to invert for a model in a different format, p, so we need to adjust
    the kernels accordingly.

    Let   m:    old model, as a function of depth, from MINEOS card
                multiple parameters - [vsv, vsh, vpv, vph, eta]
          p:    new model
                multiple parameters - [s, t]
          c:    observed phase velocities, Love stacked on top of Rayleigh

    The MINEOS kernels are a matrix of dc/dm
        i.e.   dc_0/dvsv_0, ..., dc_0/dvsv_M, dc_0/dvsh_0, ..., dc_0/deta_M
            [       :     ,  : ,      :     ,      :     ,  : ,      :      ]
                dc_N/dvsv_0, ..., dc_N/dvsv_M, dc_N/dvsh_0, ..., dcN_deta_M

    We want a matrix of dc/dp
        i.e.   dc_0/ds_0, ..., dc_0/ds_P, dc_0/dt_0, ..., dc_0/dt_D
            [       :   ,  : ,    :     ,    :     ,  : ,    :      ]
               dc_N/ds_0, ..., dc_N/ds_P, dc_N/dt_0, ..., dc_N/dt_D


    As dx/dy = dx/da * da/dy, we need to find the matrix dm/dp
        i.e.   dvsv_0/ds_0, ..., dvsv_0/ds_P, dvsv_0/dt_0, ..., dvsv_0/dt_D
                    :     ,  : ,    :       ,    :       ,  : ,    :
            [  dvsv_M/ds_0, ..., dvsv_M/ds_P, dvsv_M/dt_0, ..., dvsv_M/dt_D  ]
               dvsh_0/ds_0, ..., dvsh_0/ds_P, dvsh_0/dt_0, ..., dvsh_0/dt_D
                    :     ,  : ,    :       ,    :       ,  : ,    :
               deta_M/ds_0, ..., deta_M/ds_P, deta_M/dt_0, ..., deta_M/dt_D

    By matrix multiplication, this works out as
        e.g. dc_0/ds_0 = sum(dc_0/dm_a * dm_a/ds_0)
    where the sum is from a = 0 to a = N.

    A lot of these partial derivatives (dm_a/dp_b) will be zero,
    e.g. for values of vsv, vsh, vpv, vph that are far from the value of s
         or t that is being varied; eta is held constant and never dependent
         on our model parameters [s, t].
    The ones that are non-zero are calculated differently depending on where
    the depth point at which m_a is defined (z_a) is compared to the depth
    of the model parameter, p_b, that is being varied.  So we will call
    different functions to build the partial derivatives in the layer
    above p_b, the layer below p_b (and, when we are varying t, the layer two
    layers below p_b, i.e. the layer below the boundary layer).

    Given that s is just Vsv defined at a number of points in depth, we can find
    the partial derivatives of the other velocities (vsh, vpv, vph) by
    scaling between them.

                model.vsv[i_b]: Vsv at the top of the layer
                model.vsv[i_b + 1]: Vsv at the bottom of the layer
                model.thickness[i_b]: thickness of the layer above the boundary
                    (controls the depth of the boundary layer)
                np.sum(model.thickness[:i_b + 1]): depth of the top of the
                    boundary layer (i.e. up to and including thickness[i_b])
                model.thickness[i_b + 1]: width of the boundary layer itself
            - Remember that, for a given inversion, we are fixing the width
              of the boundary layer and only varying the depth to the top of
              of the boundary layer.

    """

    To convert the MINEOS kernels (dc/dm) to inversion model kernels (dc/dp),
    we need to define the matrix dm/dp (dc/dp = dc/dm * dm/dp).  We divide
    our inversion model, p, into two parts: the defined velocities at various
    depths (s) and the depth and thickness of certain boundary layers of
    interest (t).

    Here, we calculate dm/ds for the model card points above (shallower than)
    the boundary layer.  In the following description, I'm replacing subscripts
    with underscores - everything before the next space should be subscripted.
    e.g. y_i+1 is the 'i+1'th value of y.

    We can define the model card Vsv (m = v(z)) in terms of s as follows:
      - For every point s_i, we define the depth of that point, y_i, as the
        sum of the thicknesses above it: np.sum(thickness[:i + 1])
            (Remember model.thickness[i] is the thickness of the layer ABOVE
             the point where model.vsv[i] is defined)
      - For any depth, z_a, find b s.t. y_b <= z_a < y_b+1
            (Remember that v(z) is just linearly interpolated between s values)
      - Can then define v_a as
            v_a = s_b + (s_b+1 - s_b)/(y_b+1 - y_b) * (z_a - y_b)
      - Note that if z_a == y_b, then v_a == s_b

    Depending on whether we are above or below the change in Vs affects the
    partial derivative, as the original gradient is dependent on the adjacent
    values of velocity.

    We therefore call distinct (_convert_kernels_d[shallow|deep]er_by_d_s)
    functions to cover z points above and below the node in y.  We do this by
    looping through y (i.e. the depth points in the inversion model), and
    calling functions to fill in the partials directly above and below this
    node in y.  These called functions find all of the nodes in z (i.e. the
    depth points in the MINEOS model) that will be affected by the change at y,
    and loop through them - thus calculating dm/ds one value at a time, first
    looping by ds (i = 0:n_layers) then looping by dm (N = d_inds, where these
    are the indices of z that will be affected by the change at y_i). Therefore,
    each of these function calls will fill some of a single column of dm_ds_mat
    ([dm_0/ds_i; ...; dm_N/ds_i]), although most of these values will be zero.

        e.g. y_i+1 is the 'i+1'th value of y.

        The values, t_i, in the model, p, have slightly confusing effects on v(z)
        because we have to go via the effect on s, the velocities defined in p.
        Let's define ib, the index in s that corresponds to the index i in t.
            ib = model.boundary_inds[i]
        Note that ib-1, ib+1, etc are adding to the indices in s, not in t.
        Let's also define y_ib, the depth of s_ib; d_i, the depth of t_i;
        w_i, the width of the boundary layer.
            y_ib = d_i = y_ib-1 + t_i
            y_ib+1 = d_i + w_i = y_ib-1 + t_i + w_i
        We want to keep the width of the boundary layer, w_i, constant throughout
        a single inversion.  Otherwise, we want to pin the absolute depths, y, of
        all other points in s.  That is, other than y_ib and y_ib+1 for each t_i,
        the depths, y, are fixed.  However, changing these depth points changes
        the velocity gradient on either side of them.  Therefore, changing t_i will
        affect velocities between y_ib-1 < z_a < y_ib+2 (note not inclusive!).

        We can define the model card Vsv (m = v(z)) in terms of t as follows:
          - Each point t_i refers to the thickness of the layer above a boundary
            layer, model.thickness[model.boundary_inds[i]]
          - For every point t_i, we define the depth of that point, d_i, as the
            sum of the thicknesses above it:
                np.sum(model.thickness[:model.boundary_inds[i] + 1])
                = np.sum(model.thickness[:model.boundary_inds[i]]) + t_i
          - As above, we've defined y_ib, y_ib+1, etc
          - For any depth, z_a, try to find b s.t. y_b < z_a < y_b+1
            CONDITIONAL ON this being in the depth range y_ib-1 < z_a < y_ib+2
                (There may be no such z_a if these z points fall outside of the
                depth range of interest for this boundary layer, i)
          - Can then define v_a as
                v_a = s_b + ((s_b+1 - s_b) / (y_b+1 - y_b) * (z_a - y_b))

    As for _calculate_dm_ds(), we loop through the values of t in this function
    to call other functions that calculate the partial derivative based on the
    relative position of the affected z points to the altered depth -
    immediately above the boundary layer, within the boundary layer, and
    immediately below the boundary layer.  Each of these called functions
    then loops through the relevent points in z - passing the index of the
    altered value of t, i, in as an argument.  This fills some of a single
    column of dm_dt_mat ([dm_0/dt_i; ...; dm_N/dt_i]), although most of these

                    (y_ib+1 - y_ib+2) ** 2 == (y_ib+2 - y_ib+1) **2

    DERIVATION BREAK
    For the purposes of deriving this, let's simplify terms a little bit.
        a = s_ib+2 - s_ib+1
        b = z_a - y_ib-1 - w_i
        c = y_ib+2 - y_ib-1 - w_i
        x = t_i

    Our equation is now
        d(v_a)/dx = d/dx (s_ib+1 + a * (b-x) / (c-x))
                  = d/dx (a/(c-x) * (b-x)/(c-x))
                  = d/dx (ab/(c-x) - ax/(c-x))

    The chain rule is d/dx (f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x))
        d/dx (ab/(c-x)):     g(x) = c-x      g'(x) = -1
                             f(y) = ab/y     f'(y) = -ab/y**2
        d/dx (ab/(c-x)) = ab/(c-x)**2

    The product rule is d/dx (h(x)j(x)) = h'(x)j(x) + h(x)j'(x)
        d/dx (-ax/(c-x)):   h(x) = -ax      h'(x) = -a
                            j(x) = 1/(c-x)  j'(x) = 1/(c-x)**2
        d/dx (-ax/(c-x)) = -a/(c-x) - ax/(c-x)**2
                         = (-a(c-x) - ax)/(c-x)**2
                         = -ac/(c-x)**2

    The total derivative is therefore
        d(v_a)/dx = ab/(c-x)**2 - ac/(c-x)**2
                  = a(b-c)/(c-x)**2
                  = a(b-c)/(x-c)**2

                  = (s_ib+2 - s_ib+1) * (z_a - y_ib+2)
