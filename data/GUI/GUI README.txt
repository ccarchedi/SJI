GUI README
Run this file in MATLAB from a directory containing GUI_Sp_CCP.fig, GUI_Sp_CCP.m, and USA_NVG_parameters.mat.  Run by typing ‘GUI_Sp_CCP’ into the command line.

Input latitude must be between 27-50°N.  Input longitude must be between 127-68°W. 

Note that this GUI works better with the Mapping Toolbox installed, although it should work without.  If you return a Mapping Toolbox error, try replacing "license('test','map_toolbox')" with "0" (remove quotes in both cases).  There should be three instances to replace.
